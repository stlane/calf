Nonzero weights are restricted to the values +1 and -1.\n#' The number of nonzero weights used is limited by a parameter. Samples are controls (at least 2) and cases (at least 2).\n#' A data matrix consists of a distinguished column that labels every row as either a control (0) or a case (1).\n#' Other columns (at least one) contain real number marker measurement data.\n#' Another input is a limit (positive integer) on the number of markers that can be selected for use in a linear sum.\n#' The present version uses as a score of differentiation the two-tailed, two sample unequal variance Student t-test p-value.\n#' Thus, any real-valued function applied to all samples generates values for controls and cases that are used to calculate the score.\n#' CALF selects the one marker (first in case of tie) that best distinguishes controls from cases (score is smallest p-value).\n#' CALF then checks the limit. If the number of selected markers is the limit, CALF ends.\n#' Else, CALF seeks a second marker, if any, that best improves the score of the sum function generated\n#' by adding the newly selected marker to the previous markers with weight +1 or weight -1.\n#' The process continues until the limit is reached or until no additional marker can be included in the sum to improve the score.\nNULL\n",
